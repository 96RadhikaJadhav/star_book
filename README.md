    A digital diary that can help you in keeping track of your mood and productivity throughout the month. Mood tracker is a good way to see how you are mostly feeling. And it helped me a lot to realise how my general mood is and to improve it. Cause I was feeling down two years ago so now when I look at my mood board it looks much nicer haha.
