    A digital diary that can help you in keeping track of your mood and productivity throughout the month. Mood tracker is a good way to see how you are mostly feeling. And it helped me a lot to realise how my general mood is and to improve it. Cause I was feeling down two years ago so now when I look at my mood board it looks much nicer haha.

## üìù Motivation

Psychologists define mood as a number of persistent feelings that accompany our perception and evaluation of incoming inducements, while the mood is a state of feeling which is a little less intense than emotion. The mood has a huge influence on the way we react, think, and behave, specifically in the actions we take and the feelings that get created throughout that process. To think positively and resultantly act positively how can anyone improve his mood without taking a glass of vine or exerting chocolates. Well, a very good idea is to organize the information in an orderly log producing the funniest picture of ourselves. This will make decision making and behaving efficiently. Is it really important to keep track of your daily activities? Will this really help? One common answer to both questions is ‚ÄúYES‚Äù. The way we feel impacts the way we think. And the way we conceive plans the actions we take, which in turn influences our experiences and ultimately, our feelings. Regular way of doing this is to make a bullet journal, but this is not something one must be doing in this modern World after all these new advancements and innovations.
